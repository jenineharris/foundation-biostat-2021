# But, we are in this together!

* Learning new skills like statistics in the midst of a pandemic and ongoing major natural disasters is not easy 

* My goal over the next 15 weeks is to support you in making your wildest statistics dreams come true

* By the end of the semester, you will be able to:
    + Import data
    + Clean and manage data
    + Choose, conduct, and interpret descriptive statistics 
    + Choose, conduct, and interpret data visualizations
    + Choose, conduct, and interpret several inferential statistical tests 
    
* The course priorities are to be sure that...
    + Materials are accessible 
    + Scheduling is flexible 
    + The instructor and TA are available 
    
---

# Accessibility &amp; flexibility

* After today almost all of the course can be done asynchronously
    + All new material is in the book(s) and video(s)
    + Weekly class meeting time will not include required new material, but will include time to work together on technical skills and to discuss concepts 
    + Weeks 14 &amp; 15 are the exception, please plan ahead! (let me know early if you cannot attend so we can make a plan)
    
* YouTube videos are captioned
    + As time permits I will review and correct any errors in the auto-captions

* Software is free and books are free or low cost 

* If you attend class via zoom
    + Option to keep camera off
    + Option to unmute and speak or use the chat feature to ask questions by typing

---

# Availability

* There are **6 hours** of student hours with the instructor or TA available to you every single week
    + Sign up on Canvas https://mycanvas.wustl.edu 

    + Please use these! Even if you do not have a specific stats question, come by and:

        + Teach us how to pronounce your name

        + Introduce us to your cat-dog-baby-sibling-mom-uncle

        + Share an amusing meme

        + Tell us about your research interests

        + Let us help you find a data set for your course project

        + Ask us about R code, R Studio set-up, our cat-dog-baby-sibling-mom-uncle, or whatever else!

---

# Where is everything?

* Course materials are on GitHub
    + https://github.com/jenineharris/foundation-biostat-2021

# Zoom etiquette 

* Please use your full name and pronouns for your zoom name 

* Keep your microphone muted when not asking a question or contributing to a presentation or discussion

* If you feel comfortable with your camera on, please do so (optional)

* To ask a question, please add it to the chat or unmute yourself to ask verbally

* If you have a cat or dog (or other pet), please be sure they are visible on zoom at least part of the time

# Let's practice 

&lt;img src="graphics/letsdothis.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* If you have a question about the course structure or syllabus, try using one of the zoom methods to ask it now

    + Type it in the chat, or

    + Unmute yourself and ask verbally 
    
---

# More practice!

* Practice using GitHub, R &amp; RStudio, zoom screen share, and the discussion board while we do an R exercise to introduce ourselves to each other

    + If you have not already, create a folder on your computer for this class

    + Open the class Github (https://github.com/jenineharris/foundation-biostat-2021)

    + Click on the green button that says "Code" and choose Download Zip

        + If your internet is not happy about this, I'll put the activity file in the chat for now

        + Unzip and move the week-1 folder inside your class folder

    + Open R Studio (not R!)

    + In R Studio use Tools -&gt; Install Packages... and type `waffle` into the dialog box that appears, then click "Install" (R will do some stuff in the Console pane, this is normal!)
        
        + If you get an error installing `waffle`, use Tools -&gt; Install Packages... and type `tidyverse` and do the alternate graph type in the activity 

    + In R Studio use File -&gt; Open File... to open the "intro-activity-my-life.R" file from the week-1 folder you just downloaded
    
    + Once you are at this point, stop and type "ready" in the chat

---

# Making the graph

* Edit the prolog so it includes your name, the date, an appropriate Project title, and appropriate purpose

* Edit Lines 13 - 21, add the eras of your life (as many as you'd like, but suggest 10 or fewer)
    + This doesn't have to be where you lived, it can be anything: your pets, jobs, best friends, anything that you think defines parts of your life and you'd feel comfortable sharing! 

* Edit lines 25 - 33, add the number of months corresponding to each era listed on lines 13 - 21
    + These MUST be in the same order as the eras you listed
    + There MUST be the same number of month entries as of era entries
        
* Highlight and Run line 40 to see if the `waffle` package works for you
    + If the `waffle` package works for you:
        + In lines 46 - 54 add or remove colors so you have the same number of colors as eras
        + Use colorbrewer2.org to pick additional colors or modify existing colors if needed
        + Highlight lines 13 to 60 and click `Run` at the top
    + If the `waffle` package doesn't work for you:
        + Delete the section titled `GRAPH OPTION 1` and then highlight and Run all the code that remains 

* Your plot may look tiny, use the "Zoom" button to get a closer look


---


# Sharing with the class 

* Practice sharing your screen 

    + Take turns sharing your screen and life-in-months graphic (or your code if the graphic is not running properly yet) 
    

&lt;img src="graphics/memes/ali-lateef-instincts.PNG" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Saving and posting to the discussion board (+ meeting &amp; break)

* Choose Export in the plot pane and Save as Image

* Click on Directory... and choose the location to save the graphic (maybe your week-1 folder)

* Open Canvas and find the Discussion Board section called "Hello World!"

* Reply to the Hello World! Discussion with a few sentences about you and add your graphic 

* Read and comment on some of the other replies

* While you are in Canvas, make an appointment to meet with the instructor or the TA (optional; remember to add it to your personal calendar!)

* Take a bReAk!

# Our 1st R workshop!

* In R-Studio use File -&gt; Open File... to open the "Week-1-workshop.Rmd" file from the week-1 folder you just downloaded
